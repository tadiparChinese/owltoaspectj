Two important challenges for mda designers are to
make business rules independent of the specific platform model
and to ensure the resulting implementation does not violate the
specified properties in the application domain. Tn this project we are building a tool that allows developers to both describe
and corroborate domain properties at run time. In our
approach, an ontology specifies domain properties and
translates it to aspect-oriented code. The implementation code
could be automatically merged. As a result, we will be able to
perform approval tests at runtime and to create business rules
reused in other mda specific models. This novel approach
shall be evaluates in a toolkit for reengineering an industrial
furnace management application.
